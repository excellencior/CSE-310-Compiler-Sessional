# YYLVAL is can be pointed to
	=> Any custom type
	
# yyleng
	=> yyleng is an integer that represents the length of the matched text

# yytext length
	=>The size of yytext is determined by the YY_BUF_SIZE macro, which is usually defined in the generated lex.yy.c file. The default value of YY_BUF_SIZE is 16,384 bytes (or 8,192 bytes on some systems). This means that sizeof(yytext) will be equal to YY_BUF_SIZE, regardless of the length of the matched text.
